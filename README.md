# Coffee Date Chronicles ☕️💕

A heartfelt web application to document and celebrate our coffee adventures together.

## Project Overview

This is a personal gift project - a digital scrapbook that captures all the special coffee dates we've shared. As coffee enthusiasts, every café visit becomes a memory worth preserving, and this app serves as our beautiful, interactive journal.

## Goals

### Primary Objective
Create a warm, intuitive interface to document and relive our coffee experiences together, turning each date into a cherished digital memory.

### Core Features
- **Visual Memory Cards**: Each coffee date displayed as an elegant card
- **Rich Documentation**: Capture the complete experience of each visit
- **Personal Rating System**: Track our favorites and discoveries
- **Location Mapping**: Remember all the special places we've been

## Card Information Structure

Each coffee date card will include:

- **📸 Photos**: Multiple pictures from our date to capture different moments and angles
- **🏪 Café Name**: The name of the coffee shop we visited  
- **📅 Date**: When we had this special time together
- **☕️ Coffee Rating**: How amazing the coffee was (our personal scale)
- **🧁 Dessert Rating**: Rating for any treats we shared
- **📍 Location**: Where this memory was made

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for beautiful, responsive design
- **Development**: Modern tooling with Biome for code quality

## Vision

This isn't just an app - it's a celebration of our shared passion for coffee and the moments we create together. Every card represents a story, every rating reflects our journey of discovering new flavors and places, and every photo captures a piece of our relationship.

The interface will be clean, warm, and inviting - just like our favorite coffee shops. Easy to navigate, beautiful to look at, and most importantly, a joy to use when adding new memories or browsing through our collection.
